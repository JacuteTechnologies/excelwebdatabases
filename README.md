**TODO**
Lets do this.

**SID**
. **Work on making own code templates instead of iframe from carbon;**\n
. Add nested sections in sidebar menu; ✅\n
. Change sidebar menu, so it is expanded instead of a dropdown, and have many nested sections within each section as a reference to div; ✅\n
.**WHATEVER ELSE BUG FIXES;**\n
. MAKE CSS FILE MORE ORGANIZED; ✅\n
. **ADD MORE COOL __EFFECTS__ TO PAGES :)**\n

**JAMES**
. Adding a second option for API: Similar to SQL, but not quite the same. Name your rows and columns (which will be stored in a different file format [not JSON or CMSS {sadly}], because editing JSON is a pain in PHP), and then make requests through a Javascript library like getSquare("vacuum-19", "price"), or getSquare("datapoint-14", "trial-3"). I think you can see how this will be helpful.\n

SID: YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEND TIME MAKING YOUR OWN CODE TEMPLATES. CARBON IS WORKING JUST FINE.

**IM GOING TO MAKE MY OWN CODE TEMPLATES OKAY? I WANT THEM TO BE CUSTOM TO THE WEBSITE and THATS FINAL.**
